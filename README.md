This project demonstrates how to integrate iOS PointSDK with Xamarin application.

The following steps must be performed to compile and run the app:

Register an account within Firebase ecosystem https://firebase.google.com and include GoogleService-Info.plist into app source code.
Upload Remote Notification certificates to Firebase ecosystem.
Request a free demo for the Bluedot ecosystem http://bluedotinnovation.com/demo.
Once your account is provisioned, retrieve and enter credentials into app source code.
